# MAC_changer
This is a python3 script which can be used to change the network MAC address of the device.

It is my first python script to take a step into understanding the mechanism of hacking tools. this python script is mainly used for linux based operating
system and has some basic concepts integrated with modules, regular expression, parsing and functions.

there is a small edit in the code where when using the 'subprocess.check_output' gives output in bytes, but the re.search uses str.
so, we use a .decode("utf-8").

i hope to make more python scripts and increase my knowledge.
